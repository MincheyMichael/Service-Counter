# Service-Counter#
This program was created to help team leads at mechanic shops better track distribution of work.
Being able to track the constant work in a mechanic shop helps keep the work fair and "even"
This helps ensure a more consistant equal work load.
#
This project allows you to add / subtract the most common jobs in our shop.
Has a constant view of all the jobs that have been given out
When you select the tech is displays their own row of service counts while keeping the main display up
Which can also be reset back to a zero total count at ever pay period or month
#  
Ran into issue with doing a live update when a service is added or subtracted from a tech
making sure the reset went back to zero on all techs (easy fix once I realized I couuld just go back to the orginal df)
#
In the future I want to add a line graph that can show the linear line of all services and how even it is getting handed out
A top tech counter to show who is already at the highest amount
Also a bottom tech to see who may be next in line for what job.
